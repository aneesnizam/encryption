The app provides an intuitive interface for users to encode and decode their messages securely.

ALGORITHMS
Vernam Cipher
A symmetric cipher that uses a one-time pad. The encryption and decryption are performed by XORing the text with the key.

Rail Fence Cipher
A transposition cipher that arranges text in a zigzag pattern and reads it row by row.

Caesar Cipher
A substitution cipher that shifts each character by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Columnar Transposition Cipher
A transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext into a grid and reads it column by column.

Vigenère Cipher
A polyalphabetic substitution cipher using a keyword to determine the shifts for each letter.

Atbash Cipher
A substitution cipher where each letter is replaced with its reverse counterpart in the alphabet.

Playfair Cipher
A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters using a 5x5 key square.
